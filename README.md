This is my page at GitHub where I decided to describe the tasks that I performed during my internship at Codsoft. These projects were done as part of my internship and are various python projects that I did to showcase my work and learning.

Projects:
1. To-Do List:
Another use of the quadrants is to apply its use towards the management of tasks. They include the ability to create new activities, view entries, and delete them; hence, it can be useful in scheduling.

2. Calculator:
Tkinter based program for a simple GUI-based calculator. It has capabilities of performing rudimentary algorithms like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

3. Contact Book:
An application for storing and organizing personal contact details. It offers the capacity to enter, search for, delete, sort and organize contacts easily.

4. Password Generator:
An app that can be used to develops a strong password to help in the creation of a more secure password. This project focuses on the creation of password based on certain specifications and concerns the use of algorithms.

5. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:
A match of the hand game of rock paper scissors. These are the pieces that consist of game’s logic and random generation to emulate the given game.

Skills Gained:

Python Programming: Improved proficiency with application on the physical field.

GUI Development: Knowledge of Tkinter for development of graphical user interface.

Algorithms and Security: Enhanced comprehension of the algorithms and having certain safe coding skills.

Data Management: Thus, the skills in efficient data storing and disbursement were obtained.

Game Logic: Mainly, strengthened such skills as implementation of the game’s logic and the usage of randomization.
